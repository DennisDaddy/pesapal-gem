### Setup ###

Initialize Pesapal object and choose the mode, there are two modes;
`:development` and `:production`. They determine if the code will interact
with the testing or the live Pesapal API.

```ruby
# initiate pesapal object set to development mode
pesapal = Pesapal::Merchant.new(:development)
```

You can set the configuration details from a YAML file at the location of
your choice upon initialization as shown in the example below for a Rails app.
The second parameter is optional and has a default value of
`"#{Rails.root}/config/pesapal.yml"` if left out as in the example above.

```ruby
# initiate pesapal object set to development mode and use the YAML file found at
# the specified location
pesapal = Pesapal::Merchant.new(:development, "<PATH_TO_YAML_FILE>")
```

And the YAML file should look something like this. Change file with the appropriate values.

```yaml
development:
    callback_url: 'http://0.0.0.0:3000/pesapal/callback'
    consumer_key: '<YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY>'
    consumer_secret: '<YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET>'

production:
    callback_url: 'http://1.2.3.4:3000/pesapal/callback'
    consumer_key: '<YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY>'
    consumer_secret: '<YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET>'
```

Change default values in ```app/config/pesapal.yml```
