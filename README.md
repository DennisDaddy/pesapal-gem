Basically it's a gem that makes it easy to integrate your app with
[Pesapal][1]'s payment gateway. It Handles all the [oAuth stuff][3] abstracting
any direct interaction with the API endpoints so that you can focus on what
matters. _Building awesome_.

The gem should be [up on RubyGems.org][4], it's [accompanying API reference
here][9], the [CHANGELOG here][5] and [all the releases here][6].

[Check out the homepage for details][2] i.e. on usage, support, issues,
contributing, testing etc.

_Ps: No 3rd party oAuth library dependencies, it handles all the oAuth flows on
it's own so your app is one dependency less._
